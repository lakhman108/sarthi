ffmpeg: This is the command-line tool for processing video and audio files.

-i ${filePath}: Specifies the input file. ${filePath} is a placeholder for the path to the input video file.

-vf scale=426x240: Applies a video filter (-vf) to scale the video to a resolution of 426x240 pixels.

-c:a aac: Sets the audio codec (-c:a) to AAC (Advanced Audio Coding).

-ar 48000: Sets the audio sample rate to 48 kHz.

-c:v h264: Sets the video codec (-c:v) to H.264.

-profile:v baseline: Sets the H.264 profile to "baseline", which is a simpler profile suitable for lower-end devices.

-crf 20: Sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 20, which controls the quality of the output video. Lower values mean better quality.

-sc_threshold 0: Sets the scene change threshold to 0, which affects how the encoder detects scene changes.

-g 48: Sets the Group of Pictures (GOP) size to 48 frames. This means a new keyframe will be inserted every 48 frames.

-keyint_min 48: Sets the minimum interval between keyframes to 48 frames.

-hls_time 4: Sets the duration of each HLS segment to 4 seconds.

-hls_playlist_type vod: Sets the playlist type to Video on Demand (VOD).

-b:v 400k: Sets the video bitrate to 400 kbps.

-maxrate 400k: Sets the maximum video bitrate to 400 kbps.

-bufsize 800k: Sets the buffer size to 800 kbps.

-b:a 128k: Sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.

-hls_segment_filename '${outputDir}/240p/stream_240p_%03d.ts': Specifies the filename pattern for the HLS segments. ${outputDir} is a placeholder for the output directory, and %03d is a placeholder for the segment number.

${outputDir}/240p/stream_240p.m3u8: Specifies the output HLS playlist file.
